**`Software Engineer (Developer/Athlete/Creator)`**

I am a full-stack developer currently pursuing my Masters degree in computer science 
with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence.
All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.
Projects in this repository were built both in a university setting and by myself based on my personal interests.

## 🚀 Projects

### [Swim Stroke Analyzer](https://github.com/noltechas/SwimAI)
_For my final project in my Advanced Artificial Intelligence class, I decided to create
a project that analyzes a swimmer's stroke technique. As a collegiate swimmer, the idea
of this project was very interesting to me, as it applied to a sport that I was
competing in and practicing many hours a day. The final project used machine learning algorithms 
built with Keras and Tensorflow to successfully detect the location of the swimmer's
hands and feet throughout a given video. From there, the program measured the symmetry of the
swimmer's features to give accurate feedback to how well the swimmer was performing
their stroke._
